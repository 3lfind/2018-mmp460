		portfolios: Fhoke Studio; one of the Wordpress Portfolio themes: Oren Theme.</strong></p>
<li>What is the average number of work samples in the portfolios (or is there a range)?<br /> <strong>
The average number of work sample is 10. Oren has 12, Fhoke Studio has 10, Melanie has
	4.</strong></li>
<li>Is there a pattern for the content areas in the navigation? What kind of pages do most portfolios have?<br /> <strong> The pattern for the content areas in the navigation are work, about, contact. The reason why is they need to identify themselves with their artwork and their bio. Also, they offer their contact information for
	communicating.</strong></li>
		<li>List at least one method for navigating the portfolio (going from seeing a body or list of works to a detail of the work to viewing the original work) that you liked. You are also encouraged to list things you do not like.<br /> <strong> They all have the navigation bars. The best navigation bar is Melanie’s. Her navigation bar is
simple and responsive. And, she makes her nervation bar on every pages which makes it
			notable, user-friendly.</strong></li>
		<li>How do people introduce themselves?<br /> <strong> Melanie and Fhoke Studio did a fantastic introduction about themselves through unloading their career, and the what skills/service they provide. They share the experience and points of view with external details. Oren is approachable, but he provides the
			information of himself inconsistantly, and he doeesn't share himself based on the career so that his bio doesn't helpful to know more about his ability.</strong></li>
		<li>Do people write about their work? Describe the process? Is it helpful? Do you want to contact them?<br /> <strong> Oren doesn’t write the work about his work, and describe his work, which is unhelpful for the
client or business to inquire about him. Contrast to Oren, Melanie and fhoke Studio shows their
			strategies and abilities to handle and familiar with the complete process of projects. You can see a title, short  paragraph and engaging image for explaining each project of theirs, which provides a quike reading for people to understand their work and make me want to contact them.</strong></li>
		<li>What is the body copy like? Is it broken down in readable/digestible chunks?<br /> <strong> The body text of three portfolios are broken down with great readability. Melanie
and Fhoke Studio’s use color strategies and justifying the body text to make it stand out in different
			devices. But, Oran’s body paragraphs are a little bit unordered.</strong></li>
		<li>What is the letter spacing like? <br /> <strong>They are all doing good on the letter spacing, which fits the type they use.</strong></li>
		<li>What is the line height like?<br /> <strong> They are all doing good on the line height, which makes everything readable without losing
			the aesthetics.</strong></li>
		<li>Do you think the layout of the portfolio helps the visitor understand the work? Is it clear?<br /> <strong> All of them doing great on the website layout using the simple and clear design and engaging people focus on projects with the eye-caching images.</strong></li>
		<li>What are the most used color schemes in these portfolio layouts? Why do you think this is the case?<br /> <strong> They all choose the white-based color schemes to stand out their work, which make the
			visitors interest more on the them.</strong></li>
		<li>What is the font like? Is it readable on a screen of any size?<br /> <strong> Everyone is using the 12 pt size of body text which is sans-serif. And, it is readable and
			appropriate for any devices.</strong></li>
