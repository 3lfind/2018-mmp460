	<h3>Part 3B</h3>
	<p>We are discussing one of the personal portfolios : Melanie Daveid; one of the company
		portfolios: Fhoke Studio; one of the Wordpress Portfolio themes: Oren Theme.</p>
<li>The average number of work sample is 10. Oren has 12, Fhoke Studio has 10, Melanie has
4.</li>
<li>The pattern for the content areas in the navigation are work, about, contact. The reason why
is they need to identify themselves with their artwork, and they offer their contact information for
communicating.</li>
<li>They all have the navigation bars. The best navigation bar is Melanie’s. Her navigation bar is
simple and responsive. And, she makes her nervation bar on every pages which makes it
notable, user-friendly.</li>
<li> Melanie and Fhoke Studio did a fantastic introduction about themselves through unloading
their career, and the what skills/service they provide. Oren is inconsistent in providing the
information of himself.</li>
<li>Oren doesn’t write the work about his work, and describe his work, which is unhelpful for the
client or business to inquire about him. Contrast to Oren, Melanie and fhoke Studio shows their
strategies and abilities to handle and familiar with the complete process of projects.</li>
<li>The body text of three portfolios are using sans-serif,which make it more readable. Melanie
and Studio’s use color strategies and justifying the body text to make it stand out in different
devices. But, Oran’s body paragraphs are unordered.</li>
<li>They are all doing good on the letter spacing, which fits the type they use.</li>
<li>They are all doing good on the line height, which makes everything readable without losing
the aesthetics.</li>
<li>All of them doing great on the website layout using the eye-caching images and share the
backstory, which engage enough to make clients to look at whole projects and understand
more.</li>
<li>They all choose the white-based color schemes to stand out their work, which make the
visitors interest more on the them.</li>
<li>Everyone is using the 12 pt size of body text which is sans-serif. And, it is readable and
appropriate for any devices.</li>
<li>All of them are mobile compliant and the content clear in all scales.</li>
