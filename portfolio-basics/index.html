4.</li>
<li><strong class="question">Is there a pattern for the content areas in the navigation? What kind of pages do most portfolios have?</strong> The pattern for the content areas in the navigation are work, about, contact. The reason why is they need to identify themselves with their artwork and their bio. Also, they offer their contact information for
communicating.</li>

You are also encouraged to list things you do not like.</strong> They all have the navigation bars. The best navigation bar is Melanie’s. Her navigation bar is
simple and responsive. And, she makes her nervation bar on every pages which makes it
notable, user-friendly.</li>
		<li><strong class="question">How do people introduce themselves?</strong> Melanie and Fhoke Studio did a fantastic introduction about themselves through unloading their career, and the what skills/service they provide. They share the experience and points of view with external details. Oren is approachable, but he provides the
information of himself inconsistantly, and he doeesn't share himself based on the career so that his bio doesn't helpful to know more about his ability.</li>
		<li><strong class="question">Do people write about their work? Describe the process? Is it helpful? Do you want to contact them?</strong> Oren doesn’t write the work about his work, and describe his work, which is unhelpful for the
client or business to inquire about him. Contrast to Oren, Melanie and fhoke Studio shows their
strategies and abilities to handle and familiar with the complete process of projects. You can see a title, short  paragraph and engaging image for explaining each project of theirs, which provides a quike reading for people to understand their work and make me want to contact them.</li>
		<li><strong class="question">What is the body copy like? Is it broken down in readable/digestible chunks?</strong> The body text of three portfolios are broken down with great readability. Melanie
and Studio’s use color strategies and justifying the body text to make it stand out in different
devices. But, Oran’s body paragraphs are a little bit unordered.</li>

visitors interest more on the them.</li>
